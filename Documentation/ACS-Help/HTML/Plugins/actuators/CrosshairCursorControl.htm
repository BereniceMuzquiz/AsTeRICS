		<p>The CrosshairCursorControl component allows mouse cursor positioning by software emulation with a limited number of input control channels. 
           A crosshair indicator is displayed on the screen next to the mouse cursor. This crosshair can be moved horizontally and vertically using the x and y input ports.
           Using other components, a stepswise control of x and y movement can be achieved, allowing full control of the cursor position. After a certain time of inactiivty (no values received at 
           the input ports), a click event can be created for generating different mouse clicks e.g. via a mouse element. Additionally, a number of tooltip icons can be displayed,
           sequentially. The currently displayed icon can be selected via an adjustable time of inactivity. The name of the selected icon is then sent to the toopltip output port.

		<p><strong>Please Note:</strong>The mouse emulation on <strong>Windows 7/10</strong> does not always work as expected due to User Account Control (UAC) settings. 
        Especially when you want to use the Windows 7 On-Screen-Keyboard dragging the keyboard does not work. To troubleshoot <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/turn-user-account-control-on-off#1TC=windows-7">turn off the User Account Control (UAC)</a> - change the level to "Never notify"
		<H2>Input Port Description</H2>
		<ul>
			<li><STRONG>x [double]:</STRONG> The mouse cursor movement in x direction. Indicated via x-Axis crosshair. </li>
			<li><STRONG>y [double]:</STRONG> The mouse cursor movement in y direction. Indicated via y-Axis crosshair. </li>
		</ul>
		<H2>Output Port Description</H2>
		<ul>
			<li><STRONG>tooltip [string]:</STRONG> When a tooltip is selected, the filename of the chosen tooltip icon (without file extension) is sent to this output port. </li>
		</ul>
		<H2>Event Listener Description</H2>
		<ul>
			<li><STRONG>select:</STRONG> changes the currently selected crosshair line, which is displayed in red color. The other crosshair line is displayed in gray color.</li>
			<li><STRONG>activateTooltips:</STRONG> displays the tooltip icons and activates tooltip mode.</li>
		</ul>
		<H2>Event Trigger Description</H2>
		<ul>
			<li><STRONG>clickEvent:</STRONG> This event is fired after an adjustable time of inactivity (property clickEventTime).</li>
			<li><STRONG>tooltipSelected:</STRONG> This event is fired after a tooltip icon was selected after and adjustable time of inactivity (property clickEventTime).</li>
		</ul>
		<H2>Properties</H2>
		<ul>
			<li><STRONG>absoluteValues [boolean]:</STRONG> If this property value is set to false (default), incoming values at the x and y input ports are interpreted as relative movement information (changes of the position). If the property value is set to true, the input values are interpreted as absolute positions.</li>
			<li><STRONG>clickEventTime [integer]:</STRONG> The time of inactivity (in milliseconds) after which the clickEvent will be created or the currently displayed tooltip is selected (use zero to deactivate the clickEvent).</li>
			<li><STRONG>lineWidth [integer]:</STRONG> The width of the crosshair lines</li>
			<li><STRONG>acceleration [integer]:</STRONG> The acceleration factor for relative movement of the crosshair. The acceleration factor increases as long as input values are received at the input ports without a pause of more thatn 200 milliseconds. When a pause is detected, the acceleration factor is reset to 1.0 </li>
			<li><STRONG>maxVelocity [integer]:</STRONG> The maximum value for the acceleration factor.</li>
			<li><STRONG>tooltipFolder [integer]:</STRONG> Name of a folder (including file path or relative file path from the ARE folder) which contains the tooltip icons in .png format. The expected filenames are 1.png, 2.png, 3.png ... </li>
