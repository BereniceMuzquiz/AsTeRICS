		<H1>Application Launcher</H1>
		<span class="componentType">Component Type: Actuator (Subcategory: File System)</span>
		<p>The ApplicationLauncher component can be used to run an external executable application or to open a URL in the platform default browser. The command and arguments values can either be set as property or dynamically configured through the respective input ports. The launch of the application or the opening of the URL can also be triggered by an incoming event (launchNow).
		The property executeOnPlatform selects the platforms on which the configured application or URL will be launched.
		<p>Together with the Keyboard- or RemoteKeyboard components, the ApplicationLauncher plugin can perform complex automation tasks, for example open Skype, choose a contact and make a call.</p>
