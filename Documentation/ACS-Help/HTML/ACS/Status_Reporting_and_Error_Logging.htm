		<p>Beside this general information, the status of each component can be requested using the <EM>Show Component Status </EM>in the context menu of each component. The following figure shows a component with a red background - this means an error occurred in this component. The status window shows this error and with the button <EM>Remove Error Marker </EM>the red background can be removed.</p>
