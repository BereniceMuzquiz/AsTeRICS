# Averager

Component Type: Processor (Subcategory: Basic Math)

The averager component takes an input stream and forwards the average of certain amount of buffered last inputs. The size of the buffer can be set via a property. The component can be used to eliminate spikes in an input data stream. Furthermore the unit can also be used as an accumulator which accumulates all inputs within a certain time interval.
