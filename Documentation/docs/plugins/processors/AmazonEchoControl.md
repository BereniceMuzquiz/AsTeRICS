# AmazonEchoControl

Component Type: Processors (Subcategory: Home Control)

This plugin is based on the openHAB plugin, but is only to control the AmazonEchoControl binding from openHAB.

The plugin controls the AmazonEchoControl binding from openHAB.
It is configured to interact directly with the binding. [openHAB documentation][1].

This component uses the provided REST API of openHAB to read and write the state of different nodes 
(called items) within the openHAB system.


## Requirements

A functional openHAB installation, 
which is accessible via the web interface (the plugin connects via HTTP REST API). 
You can run either HTTP or HTTPS, in order to fulfill any security requirements. 

**Is not implemented right now. (Date: 12.01.2020)**

In addition, it is also possible to provide HTTP basic authentication with username/password. 
Please note, that any saved password in the AsTeRICS model is stored in the model file in PLAINTEXT!
  
To run openHAB without password authentication, start openHAB with this command:

On Linux:  
_bash ./start\_debug.sh_

On Windows:  
in the openHAB folder, double click on start_debug.sh

**Is not implemented right now. (Date: 12.01.2020)**  
To start with password authentication, use following command:  
_bash ./start\_debug.sh -Djava.security.auth.login.config=./etc/login.conf_  
The user configuration is handled via this file:  
_openHAB\_runtime/configurations/users.cfg_ Please note, that the first line is necessary, so do not remove it!  
Further information on configuration and usage of openHAB is available on the openHAB GitHub page ([openHAB wiki][2]).

After the installation and openHAB is running, start the browser and use localhost:8080 for HTTP and localhost:8443 for HTTPS.
([openHAB installation guide][3]).

Initial setup of openHAB and installation of the AmazonEchoControl binding:<br/> ([openHAB first-time setup][4])
1. Select the **Standard (recommended setup)**, this step can take a while
2. Select the **PAPER UI**
3. Go to **Add-ons** in the control panel and on Tab **BINDINGS** and search for **Amazon Echo Control Binding** and click on install 
4. Go to **Configuration** and click on **Things** and create a new Amazon Echo Control Binding Thing
5. Click on **Amazon Account** and accept it by pressing on the tick
6. After that, use this link to connect openHAB with your **Amazon Account** (http://localhost:8080/amazonechocontrol/) 
7. Back in the **Configuration** menu and click on **Things**, the account should be online 
8. If everything worked, go to **Inbox** and accept the two new **Things**
9. The things will show up in the **Control** area 

(if not follow the instruction at: [openHAB: AmazonEchoControl-Binding][5])

#### Input Port Description

*   **jsonCommand \[string\]:** New state for a item, for example {"ItemSuffix": "player", "value": "PLAY"}, 
ItemSuffix is the name of the item and value is the new state of this item (http://localhost:8080/rest/items), 
the itemsuffix has to be written lowercase and the value has to be written in uppercase

    * {"musicProviderId": "player", "value": "SPOTIFY"} for changing the provider
    * {"musicProviderId": "volume", "value": "50"} for changing the volume
    * {"musicProviderId": "playMusicVoiceCommand", "value": "Yesterday from the Beatles"} for listening to a new song


#### Output Port Description

*   **currentState** The current state of the item, which was last change
*   **cmdResponse** Shows **OK** if the cmd was correct and **ERROR** if it was not and an error message

#### Event Listener Description

## Properties

*   **updaterate \[integer\]:** Time in milliseconds, which will ellapse between each status update. Default: 1s (1000ms)
*   **hostname \[string\]:** Hostname to connect to. It is possible to use a hostname, an IP adress or a FQDN
*   **port \[string\]:** Port of the openHAB installation. Defaults: 8080 for HTTP, 8443 for HTTPS. Please take care of any blocking firewall.
*   **protocol:** Protocol to connect to openHAB. Either http or https may be used (recommended: https).
*   **lazyCertificates \[boolean\]:** If this property is set, any SSL related certificate check will be removed for the given hostname. This affects the hole ARE.
*   **username \[string\]:** This property is used, if the HTTP basic authentication of openHAB is used. Provide the username here.
*   **password \[string\]:** This property is used, if the HTTP basic authentication of openHAB is used. Provide the password here.

## Additional hints

*   The model will stop with an error message, if one of the item names in the properties is not found.
*   There is no feedback for checking a successful state change. E.g.: if your write to a read-only item (temperature sensor), nothing will happen
*   Use the _lazyCertificates_ property with care, it will disable a major part of the SSL handshaking for the whole Java session. It should be limited to the given hostname only, but without warranty.
*   The username/password combination from the properties is saved in PLAINTEXT in the model file, so handle it with care.
