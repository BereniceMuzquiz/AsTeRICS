# User Interfaces

AsTeRICS provides two different types of user interfaces, which can be used for a model.

## ARE GUI

The ARE provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) desktop. When designing a model with the ACS or WebACS you can use plugins which provide user interface elements like a slider or a button. You can then define where the element should be shown on the ARE desktop. Furthermore you can define actions depending on user input.

For more details, please see the respective user manuals.

## Grid

::: danger Experimental
The Grid is still experimental and not yet integrated into the workflows for designing a model.
:::

The grid is a web-based user interface which can be used for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). It can be connected to a model and be used to trigger actions.

For more details, please go to the[AsTeRICS Grid web application](https://asterics.github.io/AsTeRICS-Grid/package/static/#grids).
