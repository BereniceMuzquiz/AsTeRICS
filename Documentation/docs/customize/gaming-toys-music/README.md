# Gaming, Toys & Music

AsTeRICS can be used to control computer games, music programs or RC toys. The keyboard input of a game or a music program can be substituted by another input modality (e.g. head movement, eye gaze, switch press,...) which emulates a key press. Similarily a remote controlled toy can be controlled by adapting an input modality to an RC or infrared command.
